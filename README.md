# Welcome to jakpartment!
This is my first end-to-end Data Science project which incorporates web scraping, data wrangling and analysis, machine learning modeling, and web app deployment.
The deployed web app has a calculator page to predict annual rent price of apartment units, interactive data dashboards with visualizations, as well a dedicated interactive page in which you can create and train your own machine learning model - without writing a single line of code.

You can try the web app here: https://share.streamlit.io/radvian/jakpartment/main/app.py

## Aim of this project
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning regression model which can predict an apartment unit's annual rent price. The dataset used to develop the model is scraped from Jendela 360, a third party online property marketplace. However, for data enthusiasts, there are other pages such as interactive dashboards and a special page to explore more about machine learning models. 

## Contents
The 'Web Scraping' folder contains jupyter notebooks that I use to do web scraping. It also houses the raw dataset straight from the scraping process. The main directory houses the streamlit web app (app.py), as well as three main notebooks used to clean data, create model, and getting it ready for deployment. You can download the .ipnyb notebooks to follow a step-by-step approach on how I managed to complete the project. 

## Running the Web App Locally
If you want to run the app locally, download the folder, install the required packages, and run the app.py by typing 'streamlit run app.py' on your command prompt. Don't forget to first change the directory to this folder.
